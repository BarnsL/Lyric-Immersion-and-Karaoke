# Research notes & improvement log

A review of every subsystem against current best practice and available
libraries (web research, June 2026), with what was **found**, what was **done**,
and what was **deferred** (and why). Source links at the bottom.

Each item is tagged: ✅ implemented · 📝 documented only · ⏭️ deferred.

---

## 0. Display correctness (the recurring "pushed down / boxes" bugs)

These were reported repeatedly, so the **root causes** are documented here.

- ✅ **Lyrics drifting down — ROOT CAUSE.** The overlay window was sized to the
  content and re-anchored each song (`H` changed in `_relayout_song`, position
  via `_geom_y`). Bottom-anchored, a shorter window sits lower; and the runtime
  **backfill adds romaji/English rows mid-song**, which grew the blocks and
  re-ran layout, so the window physically jumped **down** a few seconds in.
  Earlier patches (work-area sizing, a lane-trimming watchdog that *moved* the
  window) only reduced it. **Fix:** make the window a **fixed, full-work-area,
  click-through** surface (`WS_EX_TRANSPARENT`) that never moves or resizes;
  position content inside it with `_lane_y0` (bottom-anchored content stays
  pinned and grows upward). The watchdog no longer moves anything. Bottom-anchored
  lyrics also keep a `_bottom_clear` gap (~10% of height) so they sit **above** a
  media player's now-playing bar instead of hugging the screen edge.
- ✅ **Boxes (□) instead of letters — ROOT CAUSE.** Korean (Hangul) and some
  Chinese glyphs aren't in Yu Gothic, so they rendered as tofu. **Fix:**
  per-script fonts (`_script_of` → Malgun Gothic for Korean, Microsoft YaHei for
  Chinese, Yu Gothic for Japanese), chosen per line.
- ✅ **Japanese read as Chinese (pinyin) — ROOT CAUSE.** A kanji-only line
  detects as `zh`, and a kanji-heavy J-pop/VTuber song (花譜/KAF) could push the
  whole song to `zh` → pinyin instead of furigana. **Fix:** `_song_lang` treats
  **any kana anywhere** as decisive proof of Japanese (Chinese never uses kana).
- ✅ **Spanish not translated — ROOT CAUSE.** The Spanish detector only listed
  accented words (`cómo`), but corridos are written without accents (`como`), so
  songs fell through to `other` and skipped translation. **Fix:** expanded the
  Spanish word list with common unaccented forms; corridos now detect as `es`
  and get English.
- ✅ **Responsive to display size.** `_auto_scale` scales text to the work-area
  height so a big TV / 4K screen gets larger lyrics automatically.

## 0b. Performance (CPU / RAM) — kept every feature

A pass to lower idle and active cost without removing anything:

- ✅ **No PhotoImage churn in scroll mode.** The karaoke fill used to allocate a
  brand-new `ImageTk.PhotoImage` every time the sung-character count advanced
  (many times per line, per lane). Now `_paint_block_img` returns a PIL image
  and the ticker **pastes it into the existing PhotoImage** in place — no
  allocation, no GC pressure, and it drops the per-step `itemconfig` call too.
- ✅ **Cheaper media polling.** `MediaWatcher` polled GSMTC every 0.1 s; position
  is extrapolated between polls, so 0.15 s keeps timing accuracy while cutting
  that thread's CPU ~33%.
- ✅ **`measure_text` cache.** Width depends only on (text, font); the non-scroll
  renderer measured every character by creating/deleting a throwaway canvas
  item. Now cached.
- ✅ **Character idles cheap.** The companion animates at ~30 fps while dancing
  but drops to ~10 fps when paused/stopped.
- 📝 Already-good: image blocks scroll one bitmap (not 100s of items), repaint is
  throttled to fill changes, the GSMTC session manager is reused, per-song lane
  count is minimized, and the render fps is user-selectable (Smooth/Performance).

## 0c. English spaces squished — ROOT CAUSE

- ✅ English phrases lost their spaces ("Summer sun" → "Summersun"). Cause:
  `to_furigana` runs text through fugashi, which **drops whitespace** between
  tokens, and the squished line then poisoned the romaji derived from it. **Fix:**
  `to_furigana` now processes each whitespace-separated chunk and rejoins with
  the original spaces. Already-squished cache lines were re-spaced once with
  `wordninja` (a migration only — not a runtime dependency).

## 1. Lyric sources

**Current stack:** LRCLIB first (duration-exact `/api/get`, then scored
`/api/search`) → `syncedlyrics` (Musixmatch / NetEase / Megalobiz / Genius),
every result verified by duration + language. See `fetch_lyrics.py`.

- 📝 **LRCLIB is still the best free synced source** (~3M lyrics, open, returns
  metadata so matches can be verified). Keep it primary.
- 📝 **syncedlyrics provider set** (2026): Musixmatch, Lrclib, NetEase,
  Megalobiz, Genius (plain). Deezer + Lyricsify are currently broken upstream.
  Our verified-fetch wrapper already uses these correctly.
- ⏭️ **Word-by-word (enhanced / A2 “ELRC”) timing** — the headline finding.
  `syncedlyrics.search(..., enhanced=True)` *can* return `<mm:ss.xx>` per-word
  tags, but the **free providers do not** for our content. Tested live:
  `紅蓮華`, `アイドル`, `KICK BACK` (NetEase) and `Blinding Lights`,
  `Shape of You` (Musixmatch-free) **all returned line-level only**. Genuine
  word-level lyrics live in QQ Music (`qrc`), Kugou (`krc`), NetEase (`yrc`)
  and Apple Music — each behind a reverse-engineered or token endpoint. So a
  word-level karaoke pipeline would be **dead code today**; deferred until one
  of those providers is wired. The renderer interpolates the fill across each
  line in the meantime (looks good for the vast majority of songs).
- 📝 **Candidate providers** (now noted in `fetch_lyrics.py` header): PetitLyrics
  (JP), QQ/Kugou (CJK word-level), Apple Music (token), BetterLyrics (TTML),
  animelyrics.com / Miraikyun (anime/Vocaloid with ready-made romaji + English,
  but plain text only — no karaoke timing).
- ✅ **"Bare Japanese" fix.** Some songs displayed Japanese with no romaji /
  translation. Cause: `annotate()` only romanized when the *whole song's*
  language was `ja`, so a Japanese line inside a mostly-English (or
  mis-detected) song stayed bare. Fixed by romanizing **per line** by each
  line's own script. This is better than pulling a foreign romaji/translation
  source: the local analyzer + translator cover *every* song, not just charted
  anime, and stay consistent with the rest of the library. Three layers now
  guarantee it: `annotate()` (fetch), `reannotate.py` (cache — found 5 mixed
  files), and `backfill_file()` + `_maybe_translate` (runtime self-heal).

**Net:** the free stack is already near-optimal; the only real upgrade (word
timing) isn't available for free. No code change beyond documentation.

- 📝 **Coverage reality check (2026-06).** Re-tested when a niche VTuber B-side
  (ピーナッツくん — TIME TO LUV) returned nothing. Findings:
  - **Musixmatch is currently 401-ing for ALL queries** inside syncedlyrics
    (even 紅蓮華/LiSA) — an upstream token breakage that quietly removes one of
    the biggest providers. syncedlyrics 1.0.1 (latest) doesn't fix it. LRCLIB +
    NetEase still work (the ~300-song cache proves it), so coverage is still
    good, just not as good as it should be. Worth periodically retrying or
    pinning a syncedlyrics version where Musixmatch works.
  - Truly niche VTuber/indie songs (a B-side like TIME TO LUV) have **no
    lyrics — synced OR plain — on any accessible provider**. That's a content
    gap, not a bug.
  - ⏭️ **PetitLyrics** (best JP catalog) is a **commercial SyncPower API** with
    no open docs/keys — not a clean drop-in. QQ Music / Kugou need
    reverse-engineered, signed endpoints and are Chinese-catalog anyway.
  - 💡 **Best next step for "no lyrics" songs: a manual-LRC path** — let a user
    drop a `.lrc`/`.json` next to the app for any song the providers miss; the
    annotator already turns raw lyrics into furigana/romaji/translation. This
    solves the niche-song gap deterministically without a fragile new scraper.

## 2. Romanization (Japanese furigana + romaji)

- ✅ Already upgraded this session to **fugashi + UniDic + cutlet** (a real
  morphological analyzer) with pykakasi as fallback. This is the recommended
  modern approach and fixed the segmentation errors (今生きて → 今(いま)生き).
- ✅ **Katakana English → English, not phonetic.** A phonetic romanizer turns
  ベイビーアイラブユー into "beibiiairabuyuu". Fix: enable cutlet's
  foreign-spelling mode (コンピューター→computer) AND add `gairaigo.py` (a curated
  katakana→English table) + `_segment_katakana()` to split run-together
  loanwords and override cutlet's misses (it gives アイ→"eye", ミー→"Mi-",
  グッバイ→"Gubbai"). Result: ベイビーアイラブユー → "baby I love you". The table
  is plain data, so coverage grows by appending pairs — no code change.
- ✅ **Context-aware translation.** Translating line-by-line loses the subjects
  and pronouns that only make sense from neighbouring lines. `_translate_lines`
  now sends each block of lines together with a couple of context lines
  before/after, keeping only the focus lines' results.
- ⏭️ **pyopenjtalk** could add pitch-accent marks (a nice learning aid) but it's
  a heavy native dependency; deferred.

## 6. On-screen dancing character

- ✅ **Toggleable companion** (`character.py`, tray → "Dancing character"): a
  small, draggable, click-through avatar themed to the **detected song's
  artist** that bobs/sways while music plays and hops when clicked.
- 📝 **Why a procedural avatar, not real VTuber models.** The request was for
  high-quality models of specific groups (ReGLOSS, V.W.P, hololive…). Those are
  **copyrighted** and aren't freely downloadable or redistributable, so the app
  cannot ship them. The avatar is drawn procedurally and artist-themed instead.
  A drop-in path is provided: a user-supplied `characters/<artist>.png` is used
  if present. A fully rigged VRM/Live2D avatar would need a real 3D/Live2D engine
  in a webview — a large dependency, ⏭️ deferred and documented as the path.

## 3. Synchronization

**Current:** Windows `GlobalSystemMediaTransportControls` (GSMTC) gives the real
playback position; a Shazam offset corrects per-song bias (MV intros / LRC skew)
with a fast-lock burst after each song change.

- ✅ **PlaybackRate-aware clock.** GSMTC exposes `PlaybackRate`, which is ≠ 1.0
  whenever the user speeds up / slows down playback (extremely common on
  YouTube). Position extrapolation **and** the Shazam calibration now multiply
  elapsed wall-time by the rate, so the overlay stays in sync at 1.25× / 0.75×
  etc. (`MediaWatcher._loop` / `.get`, `_consume_async`).
- ✅ **Reuse the session manager.** The watcher was calling
  `MediaManager.request_async()` every 0.1 s; it now requests once and reuses
  it (re-requesting only after an error). Less overhead per poll.
- ✅ (earlier this session) **Fast-lock burst + short re-sync captures + tighter
  correction** — see the sync commit.
- ⏭️ **Event-driven** updates (`PlaybackInfoChanged` / `TimelinePropertiesChanged`)
  instead of a 0.1 s poll — marginally lower CPU, but the poll is already cheap
  and simpler/robust. Deferred.

## 4. Rendering & performance

**Current:** a transparent, click-through Tk canvas. Scroll-through renders each
line as **one `PhotoImage`** (image block) and moves the whole stream in a single
call; lanes + block height adapt per song.

- 📝 **Tk Canvas is inherently CPU-bound and O(n) per item** (no GPU, no batch
  rendering). Best-practice mitigations are exactly what we already do: reuse
  items, group with tags, batch moves, and rasterize many glyphs into one image.
  The per-song adaptive layout (this session) further cuts item count.
- ⏭️ **GPU backend.** A step-change in rendering performance would require
  leaving Tk for a hardware-accelerated surface — **PyQt/PySide `QGraphicsView`**
  or a layered **Direct2D** window. That's a substantial rewrite of the overlay
  shell, so it's deferred and recorded here as the future path if CPU ever
  becomes a problem. Today's frame budget is fine (16 ms loop, light per-frame
  work).

## 5. Translation (→ English)

- ✅ **Optional DeepL.** `deep-translator` still defaults to the free Google
  endpoint (no key needed), but if a `DEEPL_API_KEY` environment variable is
  present the fetcher uses **DeepL**, which is noticeably better for JP/CJK→EN.
  (`fetch_lyrics._make_translator`.)

## What changed in code (this pass)

| Area | Change | Where |
|------|--------|-------|
| Sync | PlaybackRate-aware position + calibration | `main.py` `MediaWatcher`, `_consume_async` |
| Perf | Reuse GSMTC session manager across polls | `main.py` `MediaWatcher._loop` |
| Translation | Use DeepL when `DEEPL_API_KEY` is set | `fetch_lyrics.py` `_make_translator` |
| Coverage | Per-line furigana/romaji + runtime self-heal (no more bare Japanese) | `fetch_lyrics.py` `annotate`/`backfill_file`, `main.py` `_maybe_translate`, `reannotate.py` |
| Display | Fixed click-through window (no drift), per-script fonts (no boxes), kana⇒ja, Spanish detection, responsive scaling | `main.py` `_relayout_song`/`_script_of`/`_auto_scale`, `fetch_lyrics.py` `_song_lang`/`_ES_WORDS` |
| Companion | Optional tray-toggled dancing character themed to the artist | `character.py`, `main.py` |
| Spaces | `to_furigana` preserves whitespace (fugashi dropped it); cache re-spaced | `fetch_lyrics.py` `to_furigana` |
| Perf | PhotoImage paste-in-place, 0.15s poll, measure_text cache, idle char fps | `main.py`, `character.py` |
| Matching | Title match is strict + scored (no loose same-artist grabs); sound is the authority and re-checks every ~20s and self-corrects | `main.py` `LyricsIndex.match`, `_consume_async` |
| Automation | Local HTTP API + rolling `karaoke.log` of every decision | `api.py`, `main.py` |
| Languages | German + Russian (Cyrillic transliteration + translation); per-line CJK font on rm/en rows kills mixed-line □ boxes; whitespace-safe furigana | `fetch_lyrics.py`, `main.py` |
| Polish | All subprocess calls windowless (no flashing terminals) | `main.py` |
| Docs | Word-level finding, candidates, this file | `fetch_lyrics.py` header, `RESEARCH.md` |

Everything else researched (word-level providers, GPU backend, event-driven
GSMTC, pitch accent) is intentionally deferred for the reasons above.
